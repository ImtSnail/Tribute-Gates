                Born in 1955 and growing up in Seattle, Washington, Bill had the support of his family behind him as he gained interest in computers
                and technology. In 1973 he entered Harvard University where he would later drop out in order to pursue Microsoft with his friend <a class = "allen-link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen" target = "_blank">Paul Allen</a>. When
                Bill and Paul started Microsoft, they envisioned a "computer on every desktop and in every home" which originally seemed like a fairytale, but thanks
                to their efforts the world has experienced an immense change in personal technology and computing. Bill is currently still a member of the board for Microsoft.

            <p>Bill and his, now ex-wife, Melinda created the "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation" in the year 2000. The goal of this organization was to 
                create an organization that would be able to support countries in crisis and aid those in financial need. In their first year the foundation gave $1 
                billion to support 20,000 young people to getting into their colleges. This was the first of many milestones that the foundation would cross. Each year they go for a
                bigger goal and each year they do nothing but their best to help those in need.
